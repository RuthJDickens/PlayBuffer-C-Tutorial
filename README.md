# PlayBuffer-C-Tutorial

This is my completed version of the C++ PlayBuffer tutorial provided by Sumo Digital - see separate README file playbuffer-HelloWorld folder.

I have followed the PlayBuffer manual provided to learn basic C++ code using the PlayBuffer framework by creating the SpyWire game.

I was introduced to structs and vectors and this is my first full, 2D game made entirely in Visual Studio - not in a game engine like Unity or Unreal.

The PlayBuffer provided some functionality as such creating game objects so I could learn basic C++ concepts and still be able to make a game.
